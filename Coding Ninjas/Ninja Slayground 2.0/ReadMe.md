# Ninja Slayground 2.0 - 21 Day Coding Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the **Ninja Slayground 2.0** – 21 Day Coding Challenge! In this repo, I will be uploading my solutions to the daily coding challenges in both **Java** and **Python**.

## About
This repository contains the solutions to a 21-day coding challenge aimed at enhancing problem-solving skills. The challenges are designed to test various coding concepts, and for each day, I will be solving the problem in **Java** and/or **Python**, depending on the problem’s nature.

## Challenge Structure
Each solution is organized by day:
- Day 1: Problem Statement.py or .java
- Day 2: Problem Statement.py or .java
- Day 3: Problem Statement.py or .java
- ...
- Day 21: [Solution 21](./Day21)

## Solutions
Each day's solution will contain:
1. The solution in both **Java** and **Python** (where applicable)
2. Comments and explanations on the approach used to solve the problem


## Technologies Used
Java: For implementing solutions where object-oriented programming is required.
Python: For concise solutions and leveraging Python libraries for efficient implementation.
