Question : You are given two numbers A and B. When A is raised to some power P, we get a number X. Now, you need to find what is the value of X that is closest to B. Example:
Input:
A = 2
B= 4
Output:
4
Explanation:
2 = 4 is closest to 4 Your Task:
This is a function problem. You do not need to take any input. Complete the function nearestPower() and return the answer. Constraints:
2 <= A <= 100
A<= B <=10 to the power of 8

It needs to be run on all testcases

Solution : 
In that case, we need to modify the function to handle all possible test cases. Here's a revised version:

```
def nearestPower(A, B):
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest power
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_power = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible powers of A
    power = 0
    while A ** power <= B * 2:  # Search up to B * 2 to cover cases where B is between two powers of A
        # Calculate the difference between A^power and B
        diff = abs(A ** power - B)
        
        # Update the minimum difference and the closest power if needed
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_power = A ** power
        
        # Move to the next power
        power += 1
    
    return closest_power
```

This revised function searches up to B * 2 to cover cases where B is between two powers of A, ensuring that it finds the closest power of A to B in all cases.
