# Coding Learning Journey

Welcome to my coding Learning Journey repository! This is where I document all the programs and projects I create as I learn and grow my skills across various platforms.

## About

This repository serves as a journal of my progress in learning Python. Here, you'll find a collection of scripts, mini-projects, and exercises that I've completed while studying Python from various online courses, tutorials, and challenges.

## Learning Resources

Throughout this journey, I’ve been learning from multiple platforms, including but not limited to:

- **freeCodeCamp**
- **Udemy**
- **YouTube**
- **HackerRank**
- **GeeksforGeeks**
- **Online tutorials and blogs**

Each program or project is organized by the platform or course I followed, with clear explanations, code comments, and references to the original learning materials where applicable.

## Contents

- **Basics**: Simple Python scripts that cover basic syntax, variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.
- **Data Structures**: Programs focusing on lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- **Functions**: Exercises and examples that explore function creation, recursion, and lambda functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Projects that demonstrate OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Web Development**: Python projects related to web development, including Flask and Django basics.
- **Automation**: Scripts that automate everyday tasks using Python.
- **Data Analysis**: Projects involving data manipulation and analysis using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
- **Game Development**: Small games developed using Python and Pygame.
- **Hackathons & Challenges**: Solutions to coding challenges and hackathon projects.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the different folders and files to see how I approached each topic or challenge. You can clone this repository and run the programs on your own machine to see them in action.

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions. If you find any bugs or have ideas on how to improve the code, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Goals

- Complete a number guessing game.
- Develop a URL shortener.
- Participate in more coding challenges and hackathons.
- Continue expanding my knowledge in Python by exploring advanced topics.

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to all the instructors, content creators, and communities that have provided the resources and support I’ve used on this journey.
